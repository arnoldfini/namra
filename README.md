## Why?
This research work you are reading has led to a drastic change in the author. Perhaps because of the intellectual challenge it has posed, which has allowed the exploration of
various fields of computer science and mathematics. This is nothing more than the result of my obsession with dismissing the classification for genres in music, calling it incomplete. From here, arises the idea to create an algorithm that is able to recommend songs based on your own meaning of music for human beings: the feelings it conveys to you. The content of this work I think goes far beyond the work of a student of secondary. In my intention to design a computer algorithm capable of predicting a kind of song for a certain mood, I had to be educated in the field of artificial intelligence and understand the basic workings of neural networks. It has also required concepts of algebra and analysis, probability functions and optimization of results. I think this is a very complete investigation that I donâ€™t know focuses only on one topic, but falls into different fields of science. I hope you enjoy reading as much as I did in my creation and learning.

Sincerely,
